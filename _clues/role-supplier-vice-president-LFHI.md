# Supplier Vice President

## Background

You are a Vice President of Rencer Suppliers, working for Paige Norton, the President. Paige is also your family member, it is a small company, after all. Rencer Suppliers has been working with Broeing for 20 years, which is why you were invited to this gala. Paige seems stressed out, though. There is more going on at this gala than meets the eye.

You were invited to a gala at the corporate headquarters of the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

The company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is an upgrade on its best-in-class predecessor that is even more fuel-efficient, faster to manufacture, more durable, and more luxurious in its interior.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a landmark deal that could be worth billions of dollars.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.
