# Airline President, Devon Sage

## Background

You are the President of Icarus Airlines, the fastest growing luxury carrier in North America.

You have positioned your company for continued growth by landing a purchase order with Broeing, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers. You are the guest of honor at tonight’s gala at Broeing headquarters where the deal will be officially signed.

You have decided to purchase a fleet of 100 planes of their new 737 Volare model. This aircraft is an upgrade on its best-in-class predecessor that is even more fuel-efficient, faster to manufacture, more durable, and more luxurious in its interior.

Securing this deal is crucial to keep up with your company’s aggressive growth targets. Broeing was the only manufacturer that could produce this many luxury airplanes for you on such a short timeline. Broeing also secured regulatory approval for the 737 Volare to be in the same functional class as its previous model, which means you can purchase planes and start flying them immediately, without costly pilot retraining.

Your Board of Directors has warned you that if, for some reason, the deal does not go through tonight, you will be replaced as President. The Icarus Airlines Board has authorized you to spend up to $3B on the deal, but if you manage to negotiate a lower price than that, it would go down as a massive accomplishment in your tenure as President.

Insider information tells you that Kendall Blair, the VP of Finance at Broeing is a power player who has the ear of the CEO. Kendall’s recommendation could make or break this deal. They are known to be a fickle and money-minded executive who has walked away from other sales at the eleventh hour. To help your case, your assistant purchased a watch as a gift for Kendall that should have sentimental value to them. Use it to win them over.

## Goals

- Sign the deal with the Broeing Corporation
- Negotiate the best price possible for the purchase order

## Notable People

Joining you at the gala are your Airline Vice Presidents. In a fast-paced company like Icarus Airlines, they might have ambitions to overtake you as President if you fail. But you brought them in, so if you go down, they go down. Remind them of that if they start acting disloyal.
