# Supplier President, Paige Norton

## Background

You are the President of Rencer Suppliers, a small European company that specializes in producing and selling materials for aircraft manufacturing.

For the past 20 years, your company has been a trusted vendor to the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers. As a long-time friend of the company, you were invited to tonight’s gala at Broeing headquarters where they will sign a multi-billion dollar deal to sell 100 planes of their latest aircraft model, the 737 Volare, to Icarus Airlines, a fast-growing airline based in North America.

However, ever since Kendall Blair became VP of Finance at Broeing, your revenue from contracts with Broeing has steadily declined. Kendall is squarely focused on margin and profit and has been slowly replacing Rencer Suppliers with cheaper, lower quality competitors. You recently learned that Kendall will recommend terminating all contracts between Broeing and Rencer at the end of this year.

## Goals

- Network with Broeing leadership and employees to gain support for your company

## Notable People

Joining you at the gala are your Supplier Vice Presidents. They are also your family members. Rencer Suppliers is a small, family-owned company, after all. It is your responsibility to take care of them and you can count on them in any situation.

The other key guests of tonight’s gala are:

- CEO, Quinn Harper
- VP of Sales, Jamie Monroe
- VP of Engineering, Robin Ellis
- VP of Finance, Kendall Blair
- Chief Counsel, Cameron Taylor
- Union Representative, Luca Reid
- Quality Engineer, Skylar Vesper
- Airline President, Devon Sage
