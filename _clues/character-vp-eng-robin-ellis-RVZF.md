# VP of Engineering, Robin Ellis

## Background

You are the Vice President of Engineering at the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is an upgrade on its best-in-class predecessor that is even more fuel-efficient, faster to manufacture, more durable, and more luxurious in its interior.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a massive achievement for the business.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

As Broeing mounts a defense against these allegations, you and your team are responsible for completing a set of engineering simulations. Quinn Harper, your CEO, expects the results of these simulations by <span data-relativeminutes="80">7:50 PM</span> tonight, so they can review and sign off on the results. You can also count on Kendall Blair, the VP of Finance, who has been mentoring you for the past three years and backed you for a chance at promotion to Senior Vice President of Engineering.

## Goals

- Finish the simulations and submit them to your CEO
