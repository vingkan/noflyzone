# Secret Update for Supplier President

Keep this update secret. You probably do not want to share this with anyone.

When you learned that Kendall Blair, Broeing’s VP of Finance, had recommended that the company terminate all its contracts with your company, Rencer Suppliers, you were enraged. Your family business has dutifully serviced Broeing for 20 years and this is how they treat you?

You did some research and found out that Kendall Blair has a heart condition that requires taking special medications every evening. You purchased a tampered version of the medications, which will deal a fatal dosage to whoever consumes them.

You swiped Kendall’s actual medications, so the VP of Finance had to ask an assistant to go home and deliver backup medications to the gala. You received that delivery and swapped it out for the tampered medications, then left it in the foyer, waiting for someone else to unwittingly deliver the tampered medications to Kendall.

You dropped Kendall’s original medications in the pocket of the coat belonging to someone who works for Broeing. After all, the VP of Finance was widely criticized and hated internally, it will be easy for people to believe Kendall was targeted by someone at the company.

Your family members know you will go to any lengths to protect them and the Rencer company, but you have no idea how they will react if you tell them about this plot. Try to get them to help you avoid arrest and frame someone else, but only reveal as much information as you think you can get away with.
