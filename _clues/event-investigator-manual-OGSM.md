# Aiden Abbott, FAA Investigator

Congratulations! Now that your original character was mysteriously murdered, you get to play a new character.

You are now Aiden Abbott, an investigator from the Federal Aviation Administration, assigned to look into alleged safety issues at Broeing.

The launch of the Broeing 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

When you arrive at the Broeing gala, you learn that Kendall Blair, the Vice President of Finance at Broeing was just found dead. One of your informants in the FAA investigation is a financial analyst at Broeing, so you know quite a bit about Kendall Blair. There are plenty of reasons to suspect foul play was involved in their death.

Use your existing knowledge as well as new information you gain from attendees at the gala to unmask both the safety issues at Broeing as well as solve the mystery of Kendall Blair’s murder. Some attendees are already aware that you are from the FAA, so tread carefully.

You have until <span data-relativeminutes="105">8:15</span> PM to investigate. At that time, you should announce to everyone that you are an investigator from the FAA. If anyone wants to make an accusation about the murder or the safety allegations, you should call on them and let them state their case.

To accuse a suspect of murder, someone must concisely state three things: what they think were the murder’s motive, means, and opportunity to kill the victim.

To request a public investigation into Broeing, someone must concisely state two things: how Broeing was responsible for the crashes and evidence that they knew about the risks.

The party will vote on the most convincing explanation for the murder and the safety issues, and based on their choice, you will find out whether or not the investigation was successful.
