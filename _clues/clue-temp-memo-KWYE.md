# Temperature Memo

Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration considered adding runway temperature as a parameter to simulation testing for aircraft landing sequences.

Broeing lobbied against the proposed change on two fronts:

1. Opposing the “backdating” clause that would require all current aircraft models to be re-tested in simulation with runway temperature as a parameter, citing the high development cost to support such a rule, compared against existing aircrafts’ standout safety record
2. For new planes, proposing a different methodology that takes into account both runway temperature and runway material composition

The proposed methodology is in review, with a public comment period starting next year, meaning the earliest that the new rule could be passed is two years from now.
