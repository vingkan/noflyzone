# VP of Sales, Jamie Monroe

## Background

You are the Vice President of Sales at the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is expected to sell very well because regulators approved it as functionally the same as the previous model, meaning that airlines can purchase planes and start flying them immediately, without costly pilot retraining.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a deal that you were instrumental in bringing to the finish line. You are due to earn a 1% commission on the final sale price, so if the deal closes for $3B, you will earn $30M. However, the deal price has not been finalized, and you have been left out of the loop, so you may have to do some digging to find out the details.

## Goals

- Ensure the deal with Icarus Airlines is signed
- Maximize your commission on the deal
