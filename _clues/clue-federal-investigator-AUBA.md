# Federal Investigator

An investigator from the Federal Aviation Administration is in attendance at the gala, with a warrant to interview employees and learn about alleged safety issues with the Broeing 737 Volare aircraft. The investigator bares some resemblance to Kendall Blair, the Broeing Vice VP of Finance, but is definitely a different person.
