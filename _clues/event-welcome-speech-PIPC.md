# Welcome Speech

> At <span data-relativeminutes="20">6:50 PM</span>, give this prepared speech to welcome everyone to the gala.

Thank you everyone for attending our little gala to celebrate the sale of a fleet of 100 planes of our latest model 737 Volare aircraft to Icarus Airlines. Broeing manufacturing has never been stronger, safer, or more sustainable than it is today.

I want to introduce you to several of our guests of honor. Please wave when I call your name so everyone can know who you are.

- First of all, please welcome Devon Sage, the President of Icarus Airlines, one of the fastest growing luxury air carriers in North America! We are so excited to be in business with Icarus Airlines and fly to new heights with you.
- Let me also introduce a long-time friend of the company: Paige Norton, the President of Rencer Suppliers, which has provided Broeing with world-class materials to build world-class planes for over 20 years.
- Part of our leadership team, please give it up for Jamie Monroe, our Vice President of Sales here at Broeing, who moved heaven and earth to make this partnership between Broeing and Icarus Airlines possible.
- Next, Robin Ellis, our unparalleled Vice President of Engineering, whose team is responsible for the smashing success of the 737 Volare, our next-generation aircraft.
- And the indomitable Kendall Blair, our Vice President of Finance. Don’t ask them about your year-end bonus, that will be handled by Human Resources!
- And Cameron Taylor, Chief Counsel at Broeing. I can’t say much more because Cameron might sue me!
- I also want to highlight two of our brightest employees. First, this is Luca Reid, formerly engineer extraordinaire, now Union Representative at Broeing.
- And, you’ll be hearing more from this person later, Skylar Vesper, one of our up-and-coming rockstars, a Quality Engineer here at Broeing. Skylar will be giving the keynote speech at tonight’s gala all about Broeing’s commitment to safety and quality, so stay tuned for that at <span data-relativeminutes="30">7:00 PM</span>.

That’s all from me. Thank you so much everyone for being here. Please eat, mingle, and enjoy yourselves!
