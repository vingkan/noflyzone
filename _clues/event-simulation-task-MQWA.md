# Simulation Task

The engineering team has been asked to simulate the performance of the landing gear on the 737 Volare in various scenarios and report on the success rate.

Someone must have the password to the simulator. Once you find it, run the following five scenarios, write the results on a sheet of paper, seal it in an envelope to ensure no tampering, and deliver it to the CEO no later than 7:50 PM so they can review and personally sign off.

## Scenario 1

- Approach Angle: 3 degrees
- Landing Gear Weight: 7,490 lbs
- Runway Temperature: 59 degrees Fahrenheit

## Scenario 2

- Approach Angle: 4 degrees
- Landing Gear Weight: 7,490 lbs
- Runway Temperature: 59 degrees Fahrenheit

## Scenario 3

- Approach Angle: 5 degrees
- Landing Gear Weight: 7,490 lbs
- Runway Temperature: 41 degrees Fahrenheit

## Scenario 4

- Approach Angle: 4 degrees
- Landing Gear Weight: 8,300 lbs
- Runway Temperature: 65 degrees Fahrenheit

## Scenario 5

- Approach Angle: 3 degrees
- Landing Gear Weight: 7,000 lbs
- Runway Temperature: 59 degrees Fahrenheit
