# Whisper Dare

You promised the other union members that you would do this dare: Around 7:00 PM, during their keynote speech, Skylar Vesper, a Quality Engineer, will make a joke about Kendall Blair, the VP of Finance. At that time, you should walk over to Kendall.

After the crowd stops laughing at the joke, whisper into Kendall’s ear:

> I hope you didn’t start charging passengers for oxygen masks, you penny-pinching fool!
