# Quality Engineer, Skylar Vesper

## Background

You are a Quality Engineer at the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is an upgrade on its best-in-class predecessor that is even more fuel-efficient, faster to manufacture, more durable, and more luxurious in its interior.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a massive achievement for the business. The gala gives you a chance to rub shoulders with the company’s top brass. Perhaps you can get to the bottom of what is behind these shocking crash landings. If there is a safety issue at Broeing, you should find it out.

Quinn Harper, the CEO of Broeing, selected you to give the keynote speech at the gala because your focus on safety and quality sets a stellar example for the whole company. Frankly, you have felt frustrated with the direction of culture at Broeing. Ever since Kendall Blair joined as the VP of Finance, the company has been more focused on margin and profit than safety or quality. You were given a prepared speech approved by the company, but you were able to sneak some changes in to make it your own, including a well-timed jab at the VP of Finance.
