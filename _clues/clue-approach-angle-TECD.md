# Approach Angle Memo

Legal department documented that Broeing recommends pilots to take an approach angle of approximately 3 degrees when using the landing gear on the 737 Volare, just like with its predecessor aircraft model.

Pilots involved in the crashes were recorded using approach angles at 4 or 5 degrees, which could be irresponsible.
