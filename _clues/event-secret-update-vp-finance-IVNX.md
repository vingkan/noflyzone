# Secret Update for VP of Finance

Unfortunately, you will be the victim in this murder mystery.

But donâ€™t worry, we have a new role for you after the murder.

Shortly after 7:00 PM, during the keynote speech, Luca Reid, the Union Representative will come up to you and whisper something into your ear. This is your cue to act. Put down whatever you are holding and when Luca finishes whispering to you, start making choking noises, fall to the ground, and play dead for a few seconds.

The game manager will come over to explain the situation to the rest of the room. After that, we will take you to another room to explain your next role in the game.
