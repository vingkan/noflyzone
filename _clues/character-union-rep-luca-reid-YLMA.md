# Union Representative, Luca Reid

## Background

You are the Union Representative at the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is an upgrade on its best-in-class predecessor that is even more fuel-efficient, faster to manufacture, more durable, and more luxurious in its interior.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a massive achievement for the business.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

You used to be a Quality Engineer, but the demands of union leadership keep you busy, interfacing between corporate leadership and workers. You aim to keep apprised of information that will affect the livelihood of the workers. You caught wind of a shocking piece of information: rumor has it that tonight, Quinn Harper, the CEO of Broeing, will announce their retirement and name a successor as the next CEO.

In your opinion, the company has lost its way ever since the hiring of Kendall Blair as the VP of Finance. Kendall thinks only about money and leadership and has created a culture within Broeing that is more focused on margin and profit than safety or quality. Do your best to ensure that the next CEO does away with that environment and absolutely do not let Kendall become the successor.

## Goals

- Find out who will be the CEO’s successor
- Influence the CEO to choose a successor who you think will treat workers well
