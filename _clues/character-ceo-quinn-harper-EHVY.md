# CEO, Quinn Harper

## Background

You are the CEO of the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is expected to sell very well because regulators approved it as functionally the same as the previous model, meaning that airlines can purchase planes and start flying them immediately, without costly pilot retraining.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes. It is up to you and Devon Sage, the President of Icarus AIrlines, to finalize a price. The Broeing Board of Directors has recommended a sale price anywhere between $2.8B and $3.1B to stay on track for annual financial goals, but you have the final authority.

The 737 Volare and this gala will be your swan song, as you plan to retire at the end of this month. Only your Executive Assistants and the Finance team are aware of this. You must choose and announce your successor by the end of the night.

## Goals

- Sign the deal with Icarus Airlines
- Avoid a public investigation into alleged safety issues with your aircraft
