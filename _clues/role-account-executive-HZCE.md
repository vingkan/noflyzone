# Account Executive

## Background

You are an Account Executive at Broeing, working with Jamie Monroe, the Vice President of Sales. Jamie stands to make a massive payday in commission when the deal with Icarus Airlines is signed. Maybe you can get cut in on some of that payout by helping Jamie throughout the evening.

You were invited to a gala at the corporate headquarters of the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

The company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is an upgrade on its best-in-class predecessor that is even more fuel-efficient, faster to manufacture, more durable, and more luxurious in its interior.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a landmark deal that could be worth billions of dollars.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.
