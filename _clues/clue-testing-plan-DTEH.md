# Testing Plan

Because regulators approved the 737 Volare as the same functional class as the previous aircraft model, Broeing was able to skip the expanded field testing phase. Instead, the 737 Volare was only field tested at one airport: San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Through 250 test flights at SFO, there were no landing gear failures, so the aircraft was approved for immediate use.
