# VP of Finance, Kendall Blair

## Background

You are the Vice President of Finance at the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is expected to sell very well because regulators approved it as functionally the same as the previous model, meaning that airlines can purchase planes and start flying them immediately, without costly pilot retraining.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a massive achievement for the business. However, the sale price has not yet been finalized and you fear that Devon Sage, the President of Icarus Airlines, will try to negotiate the price down at the eleventh hour.

The Broeing Board of Directors has recommended a sale price anywhere between $2.8B and $3.1B to stay on track for annual financial goals, but Quinn Harper, your CEO, has the final authority. Jamie Monroe, the VP of Sales, is also owed a 1% commission on the final deal price. If the sale were to close for $3B, Jamie’s commission would be $30M.

Additionally, the CEO has a secret announcement tonight: they will retire at the end of the month. They must choose a successor by the end of the night and you should advise them on their selection.

Many in the organization have suggested that Robin Ellis, the VP of Engineering, is suited for even higher leadership, but you know that they will struggle. Robin has been your mentee for the past three years, but they have been criticized for lack of business understanding. You had to recommend against Robin’s promotion to Senior Vice President of Engineering due to this and other challenges, but Robin does not know this yet.

## Goals

- Ensure the deal with Icarus Airlines is signed
- Advise the CEO on choosing a successor
- Break the news to Robin Ellis that they are not being promoted to Senior VP
