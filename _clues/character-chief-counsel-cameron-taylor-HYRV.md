# Chief Counsel, Cameron Taylor

## Background

You are the Chief Counsel at the Broeing Corporation, one of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.

Your company has achieved a breakthrough in aircraft design with your new Broeing 737 Volare model. This aircraft is expected to sell very well because regulators approved it as functionally the same as the previous model, meaning that airlines can purchase planes and start flying them immediately, without costly pilot retraining.

Tonight’s gala will celebrate a purchase order for Icarus Airlines to acquire a fleet of 100 737 Volare planes, a massive achievement for the business.

Unfortunately, the launch of the 737 Volare has been mired in criticism. Three of the planes have crashed upon landing, leading to hundreds of injuries, but thankfully no deaths. Pilots, regulators, and the press are calling for airlines to ground the aircraft and claiming that Broeing knowingly ignored safety issues with the design.

Check in on the leadership team. If Broeing is to overcome these allegations, the CEO, VP of Sales, VP of Engineering, and VP of Finance must all be aligned. On top of the purported safety issues, Jamie Monroe, the VP of Sales, is eager to earn their commission on the Icarus airlines deal. Robin Ellis, the VP of Engineering is hoping to earn a promotion to Senior VP. Later tonight, Kendall Blair, the VP of Finance, is going to break the news to Robin that they are not being promoted. Kendall is the easiest to keep in line. They only care about finances, not legal and regulatory battles. Bring Kendall a bottle of their favorite drink and things will go smoothly.

Keep an eye on other employees who might leak information outside the company. You do not want the situation to be misinterpreted by regulators or the public.

## Goals

- Avoid a public investigation into alleged safety issues with your aircraft
- Keep the leadership team aligned on how to talk about the alleged safety issues

## Notable People

Joining you at the gala are your Associate Counsels. They are still first-year associates, so their knowledge of corporate law leaves much to be desired, but if you keep a tight leash on them, they can help you protect the best interests of the company.

- VP of Sales, Jamie Monroe
- VP of Engineering, Robin Ellis
- VP of Finance, Kendall Blair
