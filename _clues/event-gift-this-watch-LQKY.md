# Gift This Watch

Your assistant found an ornamental watch for you to give as a gift to Kendall Blair, the Broeing VP of Finance. The watch depicts Kendallâ€™s favorite lake, which they would visit frequently as a child. Give it to Kendall as a gift at <span data-relativeminutes="15">6:45 PM</span>. If Kendall is busy talking to someone else, make you give them the gift, then move on, you do not need to talk to them for long.

Tell Kendall to use this code to get the watch: **ULZK**
