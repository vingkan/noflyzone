# Keynote Speech

> At 7:00 PM, give this keynote speech to all the attendees of the gala.

Good evening, everyone. My name is Skylar Vesper and I have worked as a Quality Engineer at Broeing for the past six years.

Tonight, we gather to celebrate a milestone that truly exemplifies what Broeing stands for—innovation, excellence, and above all, an unwavering commitment to safety and quality. The signing of this monumental deal with Icarus Airlines, for 100 of our latest 737 Volare aircraft, marks not just a triumph in aviation technology, but also a shared vision of taking to the skies with confidence and pride.

As someone who’s spent countless hours on the factory floor, ensuring that every rivet and bolt meets the highest standards, I can tell you firsthand that quality doesn’t come easy. It’s the result of dedication, rigorous testing, and sometimes, tough decisions.

Speaking of tough decisions, let me share a story about a moment that reminded me why I love what I do. A few months ago, during the final phase of testing, we faced a small but critical issue with one of the 737 Volare's components. It wasn’t anything that would have been caught by the average eye—it passed initial inspections and tests. But one of my teammates, Emily, noticed something that just didn’t sit right with her. The component’s wear and tear over time could potentially pose a risk in extreme conditions.
Now, we were under tight deadlines, and fixing the issue meant delaying the entire production line.

Emily could have easily let it go, but instead, she insisted on running a full analysis. Her persistence paid off—we discovered a flaw that, though minor, could have caused significant problems down the road. Because of her commitment to safety, we were able to redesign the part, and the 737 Volare is all the better for it. Emily’s vigilance is a testament to the culture we’ve built here at Broeing—where doing what’s right comes before doing what’s easy.

Now, I wouldn’t be doing my job as a keynote speaker without a little humor, so I hope Kendall Blair, our penny-pinching Vice President of Finance, won’t mind if I take a moment to lighten the mood. Kendall’s so focused on the bottom line that I hear the finance department is working on a new safety protocol: every emergency exit comes with a toll booth. Hey, safety’s important, but so is revenue!

In all seriousness, the 737 Volare is more than just a plane. It’s a symbol of what we can achieve when we all—engineers, designers, safety inspectors, and yes, even finance—work together towards a common goal. And tonight, we celebrate not just this deal, but the promise that every plane we deliver is a commitment to the safety of everyone who steps on board.

Thank you, Icarus Airlines, for your trust in us. And thank you to the entire Broeing team for your hard work and dedication. Here’s to many more years of soaring success together!
